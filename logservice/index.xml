      <description>The LogService is a system which manages a collection of logs. Each of these logs has a defined state which allows certain operations on that log or corresponds to actions that the system is taking on that log.
OPEN This is the first state for a Log which is created in the LogService. A Log which is OPEN can be read from or written to. This Log has a corresponding Raft Group (a quorum of servers) who are participating in the hosting of this Log.</description>

      <description>The Ratis LogService is an distributed, log implementation built on top of Apache Ratis. The LogService is a &amp;ldquo;recipe&amp;rdquo; on top of Apache Ratis, providing a higher-level API as compared to Ratis itself. The LogService provides the ability to create named, durable, append-only data structures with the ability to perform linear reads.
Like Ratis, the LogService is designed to be embedded into another application as a library, as opposed to a standalone daemon.</description>
