      <description>The Docker orchestration is comprised of the following:
 A Docker image which has the necessary software to run the LogService A docker-compose.yml file which can launch the necessary containers for a full-fledged LogService &amp;ldquo;cluster&amp;rdquo; Scripts to build the Docker image and launch a client environment to interact with a running cluster via Compose.  Building the Docker image $ mvn clean package assembly:single -DskipTests $ cd ratis-logservice &amp;amp;&amp;amp; .</description>

      <description>Ratis is a Raft protocol library in Java. It&amp;rsquo;s not a standalone server application like Zookeeper or Consul.
Examples To demonstrate how to use Ratis from the code, Please look at the following examples.
 Arithmetic example: This is a simple distributed calculator that replicates the values defined and allows user to perform arithmetic operations on these replicated values.
 FileStore example: This is an example of using Ratis for reading and writing files.</description>

      <title>LogService</title>

      <description>The Ratis LogService is an distributed, log implementation built on top of Apache Ratis. The LogService is a &amp;ldquo;recipe&amp;rdquo; on top of Apache Ratis, providing a higher-level API as compared to Ratis itself. The LogService provides the ability to create named, durable, append-only data structures with the ability to perform linear reads.
Like Ratis, the LogService is designed to be embedded into another application as a library, as opposed to a standalone daemon.</description>

      <description>The LogService presently has two means for testing itself: Docker with Compose orchestration and VirtualBox with Vagrant orchestration.
Docker is suitable for a quick and lightweight orchestration of a full LogService installation. Vagrant, while heavier-weight that the Docker automation, has the added benefit of being able to leverage Namazu for failure scenarios. Please find more on each using the below references.
