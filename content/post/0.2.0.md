0.2.0 is the second Apache release and the first release which provides binary release with example Raft applications.

It contains more than 130 bug fixes and features since the previous release.

This version also heavily tested with [Apache Ozone](https://ozone.apache.org) where Apache Ratis is used to replicate raw Hadoop data.

The release is available from the downloaded section or (as Ratis is a java library) from the Apache and Maven central maven repositories.
